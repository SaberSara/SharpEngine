# SharpEngine
 A small Game Engine written in C#

# Overview
This is a course followed in the Game Programming education at [Forsbergs Skola, Sweden](https://github.com/forsbergsskola-se), lectured by [Marc Zaku](https://github.com/marczaku),
We had to create this engine based on the instructions and following the course by our lecturer, the purpose is to understand basic math equations and operations needed for games and 3D simulations in a game Engine, to understad how most of the game engine works and ti have solid foundations for an 'ahead of the curve' game developer skillset.

The course is also going along with extra materials, mostly with the following book (Learn OpenGL, official link : https://learnopengl.com/)
